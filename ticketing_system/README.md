# Ticketing System Decentralized App

This is a decentralized ticketing app which host a number of events. Each event has a limited number of tickets which can be bought using a decentralized wallet.

This application hosts three different entities as far as payment is concerned:

- **Event Organizers**: The ones who will host an event.
- **Site Owner/Middle Man**: The one who owns the site and provides a gateway for Organizers and participants to connect.
- **Participants**: The one who pays for the event ticket in order to attend it.

> By default the Middle Man is set to have 20% share rom every ticket sold but that setting can be changed from within the smart contract named as `EventManagement.sol`.
